# Covid Detection with X-Ray and PyTorch 

## Introduction

We will use the [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) to see if we can classify X-Ray images and detect the presence of Covid on them.

The datasets contains auround 3900 images. Among them, 1200 come from COVID-19 positive patients, 1345 from patients suffering viral pneumonia and finally 1341 from healthy people.

We will take ResNet-18 and fine-tune it.

All this will be done using the PyTorch framework.
